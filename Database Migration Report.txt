Database Migration Report: MySQL to PostgreSQL

1. Introduction
The purpose of this report is to document the process of migrating data from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL database. This migration ensures data integrity and system compatibility while maintaining performance.

2. Migration Process

2.1. Database Schema Migration

Extracted the schema from MySQL using mysqldump --no-data.

Converted MySQL-specific data types and constraints to PostgreSQL equivalents.

Created the tables in PostgreSQL using the modified schema.

2.2. Data Extraction and Transformation

Retrieved data from MySQL using a Python script.

Converted MySQL-specific syntax to PostgreSQL-friendly formats.

Ensured proper encoding and format consistency.

2.3. Data Loading

Inserted transformed data into PostgreSQL using batch inserts.

Verified that the primary keys and constraints were correctly maintained.

3. Data Integrity Checks

Row counts were compared between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Data consistency was verified by running checksums on key columns.

Referential integrity was validated using foreign key constraints.

4. Challenges and Solutions

Data Type Differences: Converted MySQL TEXT to PostgreSQL TEXT and AUTO_INCREMENT to SERIAL.

Indexing Differences: Adjusted indexing strategies for PostgreSQLâ€™s optimizer.

Performance Optimization: Used bulk inserts and disabled indexes temporarily to speed up migration.

5. Conclusion
The migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL was successfully completed with data integrity maintained. The scripts and process outlined here can be used for future migrations.
